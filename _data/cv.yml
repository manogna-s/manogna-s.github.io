  contents:
    - title: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
      items:
        - Designing methods to learn using labeled source along with unlabeled target domain data to obtain robust representations generalizing across domains.
    - title: Cross-Domain Few Shot Learning
      items:
        - Designing effective methods capable of adapting a base model to an unseen task from an unseen domain given limited training samples.
    - title: Source-Free Domain Adaptation
      items:
        - The objective is to adapt a model trained on a source domain to a target domain using only unlabelled samples.
    - title: Test-Time Adaptation
      items:
        - The goal is to adapt a source trained model to a test domain in an online manner. The test domains can be continuously changing as well.
